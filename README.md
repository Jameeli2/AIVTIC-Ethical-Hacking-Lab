Project:
AIVTIC Ethical Hacking Lab
Project Overview
This repository is created for the AIVTIC Ethical Hacking project. It contains resources and guides for setting up a virtual lab environment used for ethical hacking exercises and demonstrations. The project focuses on practical skills in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and information gathering using various open-source tools.
Objectives:
1. Lab Setup:
   - Create a virtual environment using VMware to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
   - Install and configure Kali Linux, OWASP Broken Web Applications (BWA), and Metasploitable for testing purposes.
   
2. Information Gathering Framework:
   - Develop a Bash script to automate information gathering processes, using tools like `whois`, `nslookup`, and `nmap`.
   - Identify vulnerabilities and potential risks in target systems through reconnaissance.

Tools Used:
- Kali Linux: An advanced penetration testing and security auditing Linux distribution.
- OWASP BWA: A collection of vulnerable web applications used for practicing web security assessments.
- Metasploitable: A vulnerable Linux VM for developing and testing exploits.
- VMware: A virtual machine software to run and manage multiple operating systems.
How to Use This Repository:
- Step-by-step setup guides for configuring the lab environment are provided under the `Lab-Setup` folder.
- The Bash-based information gathering framework is available under the `Information-Gathering-Framework` folder with instructions on how to run the script.
- Collaborators can clone this repository, contribute to the project, or follow the guides to set up their own ethical hacking environment.
